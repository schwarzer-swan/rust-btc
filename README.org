#+title: A simple Bitcoin implementation in Rust
A simple implementation of Bitcoin in Rust based on the book [[https://braiins.com/books/building-bitcoin-in-rust][Building bitcoin in Rust]]

** Getting started
Note, this is work in progress, and the instruction will change as I study to book and experiment

This is a nix flake project, however, if you have all the required software installed, you are not obligated to use nix.
For that reason, the nix folder is a /hidden/ folder.

#+begin_src shell
nix develop ./.nix
cargo build --all
#+end_src

There are a number of generators in the [[./src/lib/src/bin][generators]]
 to experiment with
 + blocks
 + keys
 + transactions

#+begin_src shell
cargo run --bin key_gen acme-keys
cargo run --bin tx_gen acme-tx
cargo run --bin tx_print acme-tx
cargo run --bin block_gen acme-block
cargo run --bin block_print acme-block
#+end_src
